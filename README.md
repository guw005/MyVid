## JS Project Proposal: HTML Custom Video Player

### Background
When I was working on my full stack project, I was thinking about creating a custom HTML video player. For the javascript project, I would like to make a custom video player library that other users can import and use. I’ll have a demo website and API page to illustrate all the functions my video player has.

### Functionality & MVP
With this Custom HTML Video Player, users will be able to:
- Start and pause their video
- Change video playing speed
- Change video volume
- Full screen function
- A progress bar in the video section
- Show current thumbnail when hovering through progress bar

In addition, this project will include:
- A demo website and APIs
- A production README

### Wireframes
This would be a custom video player library that others users can import to their project. I will have a demo website having a video at the center and users can see the APIs when the scroll down the webpage.

### Architecture and Technologies
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- JavaScript for the video functions
- HTML5 for demo website and APIs

### Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Setup the project with a HTML file and a javascript file.
- Get familiar with HTML’s video tag API 
- Starting with simple functions like play and pause

Day 2: Working on the other functions like changing volume and changing playing speed.

Day 3: Working on the progress bar.
- Figure out how the browsing bar and the playing bar work and how to render them.

Day 4: Implement current thumbnails into progress bar when users hover over the progress bar
- Have multiple thumbnails at different time when the user upload their video.
- Set each thumbnail to their corresponding time frame.
- When the user hovers over the progress bar, the thumbnail will show up.

### Bonus features
- Choose different languages for the video player
- Add captions
